**Source of data**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayessa/salary-prediction-classification)

**Description**: Extraction of data done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes less or equal to $50k or more a year. The dataset includes numerical and categorical data. 

*   **Target**: Salary
*   This is a **Classification** problem


*   **Features**: 14 total


*   **Rows**: 32,537


*   **Challenges**: Since the data derives from old census data, there may be data that is missing. Real world data seems to have challenges with possible inconsistent values due to user error or incorrect dates.


## Methods
#### Handling Missing/Duplicate Values
This dataset contained no missing values while there were 24 duplicates values. Duplicate values were dropped as they represent an insignificant amount of data within our dataset.
